# Console-Shooting-Game
This is simple console shooting game project which I made on second semester of my studies.
After compiling it you have to enter numer of columns and rows of the board.
Then you have to provide 2 parameters which determinate difficulty of the game.
You win when you destroy one full column.
You lose when one of the columns touches "the ground".
